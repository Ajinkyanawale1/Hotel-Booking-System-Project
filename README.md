# Hotel Booking System Project

## Project Overview

The Hotel Booking System project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to gain insights into booking trends, customer preferences, and seasonal demands. Using Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, this project helps in understanding booking patterns, cancellation rates, and customer behavior.

## Key Objectives

1. **Booking Trends Analysis**:
   - Analyze trends in hotel bookings over time, including peak booking periods and seasonal effects.
   - Identify the most popular room types and customer preferences.
   
2. **Cancellation Analysis**:
   - Analyze the reasons behind booking cancellations.
   - Determine factors that influence cancellations (e.g., booking lead time, room type).

3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Segment customers based on booking behavior and preferences.
   - Understand demographic patterns and customer loyalty.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes information such as:
- **Booking ID**: Unique identifier for each booking.
- **Check-in Date**: Date when the customer checks in.
- **Check-out Date**: Date when the customer checks out.
- **Room Type**: Type of room booked by the customer.
- **Lead Time**: Number of days between booking and check-in.
- **Cancellation**: Whether the booking was canceled.
- **Customer Type**: Whether the customer is a returning guest or a new one.
- **Number of Guests**: Number of guests in the booking.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for data analysis and visualization:
  - **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning.
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for creating insightful visualizations.
  - **Scikit-learn** for predictive modeling and clustering.
  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis.

## Key Analysis & Visualizations

1. **Booking Trends**:
   - A line graph showing booking frequency over time to identify peak booking periods.
   - A bar chart showing the most popular room types.

2. **Cancellation Analysis**:
   - A pie chart showing the percentage of canceled vs. confirmed bookings.
   - A heatmap to show the correlation between booking lead time, room type, and cancellation likelihood.

3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - A scatter plot clustering customers based on booking behavior.
   - Box plots to show the distribution of bookings based on customer type and length of stay.

## Predictive Modeling

- **Booking Cancellation Prediction**:
  - Implemented machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict booking cancellations based on lead time, room type, and other factors.
  - Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Installation and Requirements

To run this project locally, you will need the following dependencies:
